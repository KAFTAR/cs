Installation:

Unzip this zip file to your Half-Life\cstrike directory, or manually
copy and paste the files in this zip file's 'maps' directory into your
Half-Life\cstrike\maps directory and place the sound file into a directory
Half-Life\cstrike\sound\tjf

(Note that the Half-Life directory may differ if you have CS Retail)

Play Instructions:

There are no weapons and buying is restricted.
Both teams randomly spawn in evenly distributed Go-Karts on the track
at the beginning of each round.

There are a total of 16 Go-Karts, and
8 CTs will spawn in a Go-Kart and 8 Ts will spawn in a Go-Kart. In a
full server of 24 players, 4 players on each team will be left to race
on foot.

*** It is advised to set mp_freezetime to 0, as players will be able to
race off in the Go-Karts before the freeze time at the beginning of the
map is over.

cs_GoKarts2 has been modified for this RACE version by including new
roadblocks and tires to indicate the track. Players must race around the
track to the finish line, which is located at the end of the indicated
track. Once a player crosses the finish line, everyone else who is left
on the track dies. Therefore, the winning player's team will be recorded
as winning the round.

Note to Server Admins:

This is a small map, so it is wise to enable client downloading so that
players who don't have the map will automatically download it when they
connect. The .res file for this map is included. Please extract the .res
file to the same directory of the map and include the .txt file in the
server's 'maps' folder so players will download the map briefing as well
as the map file.
