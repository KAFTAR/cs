"We received a call, coming from Black Mesa. Terrorists would have taken scientists as hostages. They would be in the Sector E, the "Biodome Complex"...

It's been a while since they want that the experiences carried out there are suspended. Maybe planting a bomb would be easier and more efficient...

Anyway, you gonna be sent there to save the scientists. But be careful, weird things seems to go on over there..."
