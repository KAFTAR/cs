extract files in directory cstrike\maps

it was from an old folder not a creation of mine

starwars - a map that specifies a desert with 8 ride able vehicles *4 per team* including R2-D2 *only in ct*

sw_death_star - a map with low gravity effects, free weapons, lasers that you can fire, and an underground pathway or 
somethin'. But beware, a hole in the end of it awaits you and traps you there.

sw_trench_run - a map that is in space, low gravity, fireable lasers and ride able big vehicles? (:D) have fun inside there
either choose from the big rideable thingy while shooting from the inside or use lasers down below to make your enemies
look like they suicided. But there is also a hole so watch out!
