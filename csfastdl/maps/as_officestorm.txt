Terrorists have stormed a high rise office building in search 
of a back-stabbing lawyer.  The firm's private security force 
is en-route via helicopter.

Counter-Terrorists:
Eliminate the terrorist squad.  Escort the VIP to the express 
elevator, which must first be unlocked via a security console.
(HINT - unlock the elevator using the only computer console 
in the map).  

Terrorists:
Assassinate the VIP before he escapes.
