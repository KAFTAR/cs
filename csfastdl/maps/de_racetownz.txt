T and CT have to make their way in to the small city as fast as possible. 
T's goal is to bomb one of the following places in the city: the park, 
the embassy or a cinema (the embassy and the cinema are at the same place more or less). 
And of course the CTs have to prevent this to all costs.

Each team has a 8 vans and can choose to take a ride through the countryside or to 
go underground by foot to reach the town.
